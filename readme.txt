---- Map ----

Navigating around the map can get a little complicated. Here is a small guide to get you started: 

#Village# – #Forest# – #Entrance# -  
   | 
#Home# 
 
There are the first 4 locations. You start in the ‘Village’, and can move into the forest, or go back home, by typing “move forest” into the console. If you get easily confused, you can take notes of the layout on a piece of paper next to you.  

---- Save files ----

You can save your progress at any time by typing the command ‘save’. Next time you start the game you will get the option to reload it, or start a new game.
